3. The username of the person asking the question.
3. The status from the following:
    1. unanswered (no-one has provided an answer).
    2. answered (there is at least one answer provided).
    3. solved (the person asking the question has flagged an answer as correct).

### Part 2

There should be a button or link on the homepage that takes `users` to a screen where they can ask their own questions. They should supply:

1. A brief title
2. A short multi-line summary of no more than 250 characters.
3. A detailed, formatted, multi-line description of the question.
4. an optional image (screenshot or photo) that should be uploaded from their computer.

### Part 3

If the `user` clicks on one of the titles on the homepage they should be taken to the details page which includes the following features:

1. The title, summary and description of the problem
2. A multiline, formatted input box to allow `users` to answer the question.
3. If the logged-in `user` was the one who posted the question they should be able to flag one of the answers as correct.
